#   Write equations w1 (right corner = hawk), w2 (top corner) and w3 (left corner = dove)
#   Remove unnecessary parameters 
#   Add parameters at the end of the list with default value (using =)
#   End with ", ...)"
#   Do not remove w0 from equations 
#
#   Edit ps.config to inform the number of corners (2 or 3 kinds of players)
#   Give the names for the corners in order: left, right and top corner names
#
#   Save this definition with no extension or extension ".txt"
