# Hawk & dove
#   individuals dispute resources (v)
# Hawk against hawk ... from a fight, one wins v and the other loses c
# Dove finds dove ... they share the resouce
# Hawk against dove ... hawk gets v without cost (c); dove gets nothing

# INSTRUCTIONS
#   Write equations w1 (right corner = hawk), w2 (top corner) and w3 (left corner = dove)
#   Remove unnecessary parameters 
#
#   Check function ps.game(): add parameters at the end of the list with default values (using =)
#   End with ", ...)"
#   Do not remove w0 from equations 
#
#   Edit ps.config() to inform the number of corners (2 or 3 kinds of players)
#   Give the names for the corners in order: left, right and top corner names
#
#   Edit ps.comment() if you intend to give additional information to users
#
#   Save this definition with no extension or extension ".txt"
#
#   Call with:
#   > mygame("Gamename", parameters, options)
