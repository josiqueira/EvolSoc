# Anarquista
#   Anarquista plays Hawk when it has arrived first 
#   (is the “owner” of the resource) but plays Dove
#   when it is the intruder.
#   When two Bourgeois individuals meet, one agrees to leave,
#   and the other claims the entire resource.
#

# INSTRUCTIONS
#   Write equations w1 (right corner = hawk), w2 (top corner) and w3 (left corner = dove)
#   Remove unnecessary parameters 
#   Add parameters at the end of the list with default value (using =)
#   End with ", ...)"
#   Do not remove w0 from equations 
#
#   Edit ps.config to inform the number of corners (2 or 3 kinds of players)
#   Give the names for the corners in order: left, right and top corner names
#
#   Save this definition with no extension or extension (e.g., "Gamename.txt")
#
#   Call with:
#   > mygame("Gamename", parameters, options)
